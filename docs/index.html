      <h1>Starbucks Analysis</h1>
      <img src="green_cafe.jpg" alt="cafe" />
      <p>
        Starbucks has been using various marketing offers, such as Buy One Get
        One (BOGO), Discount, and Informational campaigns, to engage their
        customers. The dataset used for this analysis contains user interaction
        events with these offers, including when an offer was received, viewed,
        or completed. The goal of this analysis is to understand which
        demographics and channels are most effective in driving offer
        completions and to provide insights for optimizing future marketing
        strategies.
      </p>

      <p>
        This analysis aims to understand the effectiveness of different
        marketing offers and how users of varying demographics respond to them.
        By evaluating metrics such as the Received-to-View Rate and
        View-to-Completion Rate, we provide actionable insights into the
        behavior of users and suggest possible improvements for marketing
        strategies.
      </p>

      <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Insights</h2>
      <p>
        During our initial exploratory data analysis, we calculated several
        metrics to evaluate user interactions with offers. These metrics
        included:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Received-to-View Rate:</strong> 74.98% of users who received
          an offer viewed it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>View-to-Completion Rate:</strong> 65.07% of users who viewed
          an offer went on to complete it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Overall Completion Rate:</strong> 48.79% of users who received
          an offer eventually completed it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The results highlight a strong engagement from users after viewing
        offers. However, improving the Received-to-View Rate and the
        View-to-Completion Rate could significantly boost overall completion.
      </p>

      <h2>Modeling Approach</h2>
      <p>
        To predict which users are most likely to complete an offer, we built a
        Random Forest Classifier. The model was fine-tuned using GridSearchCV,
        which helped in identifying the best hyperparameters. After careful
        evaluation, the final model achieved an accuracy of
        <strong>91%</strong> on the test set. The feature importance plot below
        highlights which variables had the most impact on offer completion.

      <h2>Evaluation Results</h2>
      <p>
        The confusion matrix and ROC curve below provide additional insights
        into the model's performance. The model showed a strong ability to
        predict users who would not complete an offer (precision:
        <strong>90%</strong>, recall: <strong>100%</strong> for class 0), but
        there is room for improvement in identifying users who will complete an
        offer.

      <h2>Key Findings</h2>
      <p>
        Our analysis reveals the following key findings regarding user
        engagement and offer responses:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Most Important Factors:</strong> The features
          <em>event_offer received</em> and <em>event_offer viewed</em> were the
          most important predictors of offer completion.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Channel Effectiveness:</strong> The <em>web</em> channel was
          the most effective in driving offer completions, followed by
          <em>mobile</em> and <em>email</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Demographic Insights:</strong> Younger users (categorized as
          'Youth' and 'Young Adults') were more likely to view and complete
          offers, suggesting targeted marketing efforts may be more effective
          for this group.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Challenges and Recommendations</h2>
      <p>
        One challenge encountered was
        <strong>offer response attribution</strong>. Determining which channels
        and offer types had the most influence on user decisions can be complex,
        as many users engage through multiple channels. The importance of
        accurately attributing offer responses cannot be understated, especially
        for optimizing marketing budgets.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Improvement Ideas:</strong> Future improvements could include
        incorporating additional data, such as user location or seasonality, to
        gain deeper insights. Additionally, further analysis into different
        channel combinations might reveal synergies that could drive higher
        engagement.
