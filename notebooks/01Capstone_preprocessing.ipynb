    "   **Preprocessing Pipeline**:\n",
    "   - **Merge Data**: Combine the `profile`, `portfolio`, and `transcript` data to create a comprehensive dataset of user interactions.\n",
    "   - **Handle Missing Values**: Address missing data points, especially in demographics.\n",
    "   - **Encode Features**: Use one-hot encoding for categorical variables like `offer_type` and `gender`, and scale or bin continuous variables like income or age as needed.\n",
    "   - **Feature Engineering**: Generate interaction-level features such as `total_spent_during_offer`, `viewed_offer_before_purchase`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Define Models**:\n",
    "   - **Segmentation or Classification**: Depending on the approach, select models for user segmentation (e.g., KMeans clustering) or for classification of offer responses (e.g., Random Forests, XGBoost).\n",
    "   - **Baseline Model**: Start with a basic heuristic or rule-based model (e.g., average spend increase per offer type) as a baseline for comparison.\n",
    "   - **Implementation Notebook**: Begin by coding the model setup, including initial performance metrics, and document any implementation challenges.\n",
